Online Waxmelt Store built in React

Building a site for my wifes wax-melt company which currently is being delivered by Shopify. 
I am Building with React as I really like the framework and think it is the right fit for this type of project. I am learning along side building the site following a complete React tutorial on Udemy and applying learning where appropriate. 

This will soon takeover as the main site providing backend with Node.js and payments with Stripe.
